This file will serve as my first project using my Arduino Uno microcontroller. 
//My first project's goal is to understand how the microcontroller works using a project relating to my field of interest
  (space stuff)

//First I need to understand how to use Arduino's IDE. I think this software uses a mix of C, C++,
  and its logic is based on if-and-then statements. Its sketches are based on two main functions: setup and loop. 
  Luckily there is an Arduino reference online for me to check when I want to see other commands and functions


###LED STUFF###
void setup () {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

  void loop() {
  Serial.println(" insert text here ");
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(500);
}

###MOTOR STUFF###
#include <NewPingIn.h>

#define TRIGGER_PIN   14
#define ECHO_PIN      15
#define MAX_DISTANCE  200 

NewPing DistanceSensor(TRIGGER_PIN, ECHO_PIN, MAX_DISTANCE);

void setup()
{ 
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{ 
  unsigned int cm = DistanceSensor.ping_cm();
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(cm);
  Serial.println("cm");
  delay(1000);
}
