This file will serve as my first project using my Arduino Uno microcontroller. 
//My first project's goal is to understand how the microcontroller works using a project relating to my field of interest
  (space stuff)

//First I need to understand how to use Arduino's IDE. I think this software uses a mix of C, C++,
  and its logic is based on if-and-then statements. Its sketches are based on two main functions: setup and loop. 
  Luckily there is an Arduino reference online for me to check when I want to see other commands and functions
