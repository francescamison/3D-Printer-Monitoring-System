# 3D Printer Monitoring System

### Project Overview
This Python-powered 3D Printer Monitoring System was developed as part of a Short Advanced Programme in Ireland, from June 24-28, in collaboration with TUS Limerick. The project focuses on enhancing operational oversight and proactive maintenance for 3D printers through real-time data tracking and analysis.

### What is it?
The 3D Printer Monitoring System is a tool designed to provide comprehensive, real-time tracking of key parameters for 3D printers. Built with Python, it captures data from sensors to monitor the printerâ€™s status and performance, and it analyzes this data to help users make timely decisions regarding maintenance needs.

### What does it do?
- **Real-time Data Tracking:** Continuously monitors crucial parameters, such as temperature, humidity, printer status, and print progress.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Uses data insights to detect potential issues before they lead to failures, minimizing downtime.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides alerts and recommendations based on data trends to keep the printer functioning optimally.

### Why Use This System?
- **Operational Oversight:** Gain full visibility of 3D printer operations with real-time monitoring, allowing users to oversee multiple printers simultaneously.
- **Proactive Maintenance:** By identifying potential issues early, the system helps prevent costly downtime and ensures the longevity of the printer's components.

This system is an ideal solution for makerspaces, educational institutions, or any setting with 3D printers where operational efficiency and minimal downtime are priorities.
